/**
 * The <code>NodeDiff</code> class takes two <code>Node</code> objects, and
 * via the <code>SequenceMatcher</code> class, determines the differences
 * between the two objects and creates a diff, which is a List of
 * <code>Change</code> objects containing a pair of Nodes, the original and
 * its replacement (or a single Node, representing an insertion
 * or deletion, depending on whether its in the new or old AST) as well as
 * other relevant information about the difference.
 * <p>
 *
 * Additionally, if given the String each Node was parsed from,
 * <code>NodeDiff</code> can create a <code>DeepDiff</code>. The
 * <code>DeepDiff</code> will contain all the information of the original
 * diff, but it will also create subdiffs of certain types of Nodes such as
 * methods and classes. By using a Levenshtein distance algorithm, which would
 * be too imprecise when comparing the entire diff, but works within the
 * smaller context, the subdiff is able to re-match changes that were
 * previously disconnected and recognized as a separate deletion and
 * insertion. Careful use of the subdiff information can be used to
 * dramatically improve diffing results.
 *<p>
 *
 * Finally, by passing in a callback, <code>isJunk</code> , which implements
 * the <code>#IsJunk</code> interface, and specifically, the <code>#checkJunk()
 * </code> method, one can instruct <code>NodeDiff</code> to ignore particular
 * Nodes, or types of Nodes.
 * <p>
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *
 * String codeStringA = "def foo(bar)\n bar\n end\n foo('astring')";
 * String codeStringB = "'a'\ndef bloo(bar)\n puts bar\n end\n foo('astring')";
 *
 * //The implementation of parseContents is left to the reader.
 * Node nodeA = parseContents(codeStringA);
 * Node nodeB = parseContents(codeStringB);
 *
 * NodeDiff nd = new NodeDiff(nodeA, codeStringA, nodeB, codeStringB, new
 * IsJunk() {
 *   public boolean checkJunk(Node node) {
 *       if (!(node instanceof ILocalScope && !(node instanceof RootNode))) {
 *           return true;
 *       }
 *         return false;
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * ArrayList<DeepDiff> diff = nd.getDeepDiff();
 *
 * System.out.println(diff);
 * // Output:
 * //[
 * // Change:
 * // New Node: (DefnNode:foo, (MethodNameNode:foo), (ArgsNode, (ListNode, (
 * // ArgumentNode:bar))), (NewlineNode, (LocalVarNode:bar))) Complexity: 7
 * // Position: <code>:[0,2]:[0,22]
 * //,
 * // Change:
 * // Old Node: (DefnNode:bloo, (MethodNameNode:bloo), (ArgsNode, (ListNode, (
 * // ArgumentNode:bar))), (NewlineNode, (FCallNode:puts, (ArrayNode, (
 * // LocalVarNode:bar))))) Complexity: 9 Position: <code>:[1,3]:[4,32]
