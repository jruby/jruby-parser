     * In cases where some or all the the LHS to RHS assignments are known then return a list of

     * Something like:
     * <pre>
     *   a, *b, c = 1,2,3,4
     * </pre>
     * will work since all values can be computed simply ([a=1,b=[2,3],c=4]).  For the case of b
     * an ArrayNode will get constructed with proper range offsets as a computed node.  This 
     * example used FixnumNodes but the node type can be anything which can be statically resolved.
     * 
     * However:
     * <pre>
     *   a, *b, c = random_call
     *   a, *b, c = *[1,2,3,4]
     * </pre>
     * will not work since we cannot know what random_call will return.  The splat case could be 
     * made to work since it is statically resolvable, but at this point we do not want to 
     * replicate too much of Ruby's semantics.  So statically resolvable but compound static
     * resolution is not currently in scope for this method (although it might be added later).
     * 
     * Note, this will return a partial list when part of the list is statically resolvable and
     * the unresolvable portions will have a null value to indicate they cannot be resolved:
     * <pre>
     *   a, *b, c = 1, *foo
     * </pre>
     * In this case we will get back [a=1,b=null,c=null].  Partial results are still useful for
     * inference in an IDE.
     *
     * @return a list of nodepairs for known bindings and null for values not bound.
